It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. Lending Club is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.The company claims that $ 15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015.\n\nLending Club enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between $$1,000 and $ 40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors can search and browse the loan listings on Lending Club website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Investors make money from interest. Lending Club makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.\n\n\n## About the Dataset\nThese files contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the 2007-2015, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The file containing loan data through the \"present\" contains complete loan data for all loans issued through the previous completed calendar quarter. Additional features include credit scores, number of finance inquiries, address including zip codes, and state, and collections among others. The file is a matrix of about 890 thousand observations and 75 variables. A data dictionary is provided in a separate file. k\n\n## Purpose of this analysis\nWe will go step by step for building a machine learning algorith for the prediction of loan defaulters based on certain variables present in the dataset. Our main goal is to correctly identifying defaulter's (True positives) so that lending club can decide whether a person is fit for sanctioning a loan or not in the future.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e08e625d4bd4f3884b79295e37163abfa8b458ec"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Packages\nWe will start by importing the packages that will be used throughout the analysis"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"edce02b2d198e896f7b3a91760d8dafe6111cb4d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve\nfrom scipy.stats import boxcox\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6d8e0238e9700d35f850eec1e0fc15bc15b5734e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"##Reading the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/loan.csv\", low_memory=False)\ndf.head(3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"aff77007bcedfcf597f23806d8f89ccd2bfafea0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Cleaning"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"48420d5feb0d5d9cf8762ba528e7a391a57b17bf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"##Finding the the count and percentage of values that are missing in the dataframe.\ndf_null = pd.DataFrame({'Count': df.isnull().sum(), 'Percent': 100*df.isnull().sum()/len(df)})\n\n##printing columns with null count more than 0\ndf_null[df_null['Count'] > 0] ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fa68a0e27bdc1af6ddf4adf84189baf39dbb8509"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, there are a lot of columns which have huge chunk of data missing.

This can be further used by LendingClub for their analysis. Also, we might want to look on other techniques or variables to improve the prediction power of the algorthm. One of the drawbacks is just the limited number of people who defaulted on their loan in the 8 years of data (2007-2015) present on the dataset. We can use an updated dataframe which consist next 3 years values (2015-2018) and see how many of the current loans were paid off or defaulted or even charged off. Then these new data points can be used for predicting them or even used to train the model again to improve its accuracy.\n\nSince we had a lot of categorical data, we cannot apply PCA for dimensionality reduction. Because of this, we can try some different type of variable selection method like 'MULTIPLE CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS' to reduce the dimensionality and select the most important variables from the columns.\n\nSince the algorithm puts around 47% of non-defaulters in the default class, we might want to look further into this issue to make the model more robust."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"64b3b6f05f85e9db601955e93144d6e2efaf315a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
